		<h1>Project 2: MeshEdit</h1>
		<p>Team Member: Jason Yang</p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>This project is split into six parts, with the first two parts dedicated to creating Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces, and the last four parts are dedicated to manipulating triangle meshes by calculating area-weighted vertex normals, flipping edges, splitting edges, and finally, performing loop subdivision for mesh upsampling.
		<br>
		<br>
		As a whole, I have learned about the half edge data structure in more detail and how to follow pointers in a more efficient manner. I learned that it did not matter which direction the edges cycled, as long as there was a consistent implementation throughout. I assumed that each edge’s next pointer pointed toward the next counterclockwise edge, but from the slides, it seemed to be the opposite. However, I understood that implementing the edges clockwise or counterclockwise did not matter.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Part 1</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</i>
		<br>
		<p>The de Casteljau algorithm evaluates the bezier curve from a list of control points and parameter t. This algorithm has list.size() - 1 steps, and each step is described as follows: we take the linear interpolation (defined as t * points[i] + (1 - t) * points[i + 1])  between adjacent points in the list (but not between the first control point and the last control point) and the list of control points in the next step consists of all of these linearly interpolated control points. At the very end, there will be one item in the list, and that point will be the point on the curve at time step t. The curve consists of the points generated by taking points from all possible time steps t (from 0 to 1, inclusive).</p>
		<br>
		<i>Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below</i>
		<br>
		<p>I implemented Part 1 by writing a function called evaluateStep that took in a vector of control points. I then calculate the single point generated from time step t by creating a results vector, and I push back the linear interpolation (t * points[i] + (1 - t) * points[i + 1]) between adjacent points in the list (but not between the first control point and the last control point) and return the results vector.</p>

		<h3>Part 2</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</i>
		<br>
		<p>The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces as well. If you have a 2D matrix (of dim N by N) of points and want to generate a Bezier surface from it, you first want to split the points into N groups of N vertices, and for each group of points, you generate N bezier curves with the parameter named u to draw the entire curve. Then, from each of these Bezier curves, you pick a point using the parameter u and take the list of points you get from these curves to generate another Bezier curve. Now you have bezier curves in two different dimensions, and you can use the parameters u and v to generate points to plot out the entire bezier surface.
		<br>
		<br>
		In my implementation, I first wrote the evaluate1D function to generate one point a 1D bezier curve with parameter t. This function calls the evaluateStep function that I created in Part 1 and reassigns the parameter vector to this result of evaluateStep. I repeatedly call the evaluateStep function while the vector’s size > 1 to generate one final point. Then, to evaluate the entire bezier surface, I create a vector called intermediate_vector to hold the points generated with the evaluate1D function. I call the evaluate1D function with parameter u on each row of controlPoints, and finally, I return the result of calling evaluate1D on intermediate_points and parameter v and get one point back. Thus, when passing in different values of u and v to the evaluate function, I get back the entire bezier surface.

		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</i>
		<p>I implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by first getting a halfedge named iterating halfedge by calling halfedge(). Then, I obtained the vertex’s position that belonged to that halfedge by calling halfedge()->vertex->position and named that vertex position A. Then, for each face, I obtained the two other vertices B and C that made up this triangle. I advanced the iterating halfedge by assigning it to its next() value, and then taking the vertex from this halfedge. I named this vertex B. Then, I advanced the iterating halfedge again by assigning it to its next() value, and then taking the vertex from this halfedge. I named the vertex C. Upon obtaining vertices B and C, I created vectors ab = b - a and ac = c - a. Then, I calculated the area of the face by using the formula area = 1/2 * ||ab|| * ||ac|| * sin(theta), where theta calculated by taking the inverse cosine of the result obtained from this formula: cos(theta) = (ab ᐧ ac)/(||ab|| * ||ac||). Then, I advanced the iterating halfedge by assigning it to its twin() value. I repeated this loop until the iterating halfedge equaled halfedge().</p>

		<h3>Part 4</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</i>
		<br>
		<p>I implemented the edge flip operation by drawing the before flip diagram and the after flip diagram from CMU's <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide</a> and made sure to label each halfedge, vertex, edge, and face.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="img/pt4-0.png" height="50%">
		<p>From there, I followed their suggestion and created variables for each halfedge h0 to h9, each vertex v0 to v3, each edge e0 to e4, and both faces f0 and f1 by following halfedge pointers. Then, I reassigned each element's instance variables to have the correct post-flip values. For each halfedge h0 to h9, I used the setNeighbors function to properly assign their next, twin, vertex, edge, and face attributes. The outside halfedges (h6, h7, h8, h9) kept their previous next() and face() attributes. For each vertex v0 to v3, edge e0 to e4, and both faces f0 and f1, I made sure to assign its halfedge property to its corresponding halfedge.</p>

		<i>Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</i>
		<br>
		<p>I did not have an eventful debugging journey. I implemented it correctly in the first try by double and triple checking before I ran the code to make sure I obtained my halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces correctly by manually following pointers on my diagram and set each halfedge's neighboring halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces to the proper value in my diagram. I also made sure to set my vertices, edges, and faces' halfedges properly.</p>

		<h3>Part 5</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</i>
		<br>
		<p>I implemented the edge split operation by first drawing the before and after diagram of the edge split with labeled halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="img/pt5-0.png" height="50%">
		<p>From there, I created variables for each halfedge h0 to h9, each vertex v0 to v3, each edge e0 to e4, and both faces f0 and f1 by following pointers from the original halfedge. Next, I created the new halfedges h10 to h15, vertex v4, edges e5 to e7, and faces f2 and f3. Then, I reassigned each element's instance variables to have the correct post-split values. For each halfedge h0 to h15, I used the setNeighbors function to properly assign their next, twin, vertex, edge, and face attributes. The outside halfedges (h6, h7, h8, h9) kept their previous next() and face() attributes. For each vertex v0 to v4, edge e0 to e7, and both faces f0 and f3, I made sure to assign its halfedge property to its corresponding halfedge.</p>

		<i>Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</i>
		<p>I did not have an eventful debugging journey. As with the previous part, I implemented it correctly in the first try by double and triple checking before I ran the code to make sure I obtained my halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces correctly by manually following pointers on my diagram and set each halfedge's neighboring halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces to the proper value in my diagram. I also made sure to set my vertices, edges, and faces' halfedges properly.</p>

		<h3>Part 6</h3>
		<i>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</i>
		<br>
		<p>We implemented loop subdivision by first computing the new positions of the vertices after loop subdivision occurs, and we store these new positions in the vertex's instance variable called newPosition. There are two different types of vertices.</p> 
		<p>First are the vertices that are not created during loop subdivision. For these vertices, we loop through all existing vertices, and for each vertex, we set the isNew field to be false and sum up the coordinates of all neighboring vertices. Then, we set a value u to be 3/16 if the number of neighbors is 3; otherwise we set u to be 3/(8 * the number of neighbors). Then, the new vertex position is (1 - number of neighbors * u) * the vertex's position + u * the sum of the positions of all neighboring vertices.</p>
		<p>Then are the vertices that will be created during loop subdivision. Since we split an edge, we will loop through all edges. For each edge, we first set the isNew property to false and then obtain the four neighboring vertices: a, b, c, and d, where b and c are the two vertices on the edge and a and d are the vertices closest to b and c that form a triangle abd and bcd. Then, we set the edge's newPosition instance variable to be (3/8) * (a's position + b's position) + (1/8) * (c's position + d's position).</p>
		<p>Then, we loop through all existing edges and split each edge, making sure to mark the vertex returned from the splitEdge function call's isNew property to true.</p>
		<p>The fourth step is to flip edges that connect old and new vertices. We only want to split new edges, so we modify our split edge function to set the isNew property on the new edges that are created during the split and copy the edge's newPostion onto the newly created vertex's newPosition. Now, we iterate through all edges, and if the edge is new and one vertex on the edge is new and the other vertex is not new, we flip the edge.</p>
		<p>The fifth step is to set the new positions of the vertices. We loop through all vertices, and if the vertex is new, we set its position to be its newPosition property.</p>
		<br>
		<i>Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</i>
		<br>
		<p>We see that after each subdivision, edges and vertices become less pointy and sharp, and they become more curved, rounded out, and less pronounced. This is because the new position of the vertices is a a weighted average of the position of the vertices around it, and since a vertex along a sharp corner or edge is far more extreme in position than its neighboring vertices, the new position is in a less extreme position, therefore reducing the sharpness of the corner or edge. We can reduce this effect by splitting the edges adjacent to sharp corners and edges so that each neighboring pixel is more pronounced than before. These new adjacent vertices are in a more extreme position than the pre-split adjacent vertices.</p>
		<p>This is how a cube behaves after some iterations of loop subdivisions without any pre-processing.</p>

		<br>
		<p>After we pre-split edges that are adjacent to an edge or corner, we see that the cube's edges are more pronounced.</p>

		<i>Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</i>

		<p>We can pre-process the cube by splitting the edge that runs across every face of the cube and then split as before.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Without pre-splitting, we see that the cube has some pointy edges after some iterations of loop subdivison. This is because some vertices have more edges attached to it, and since the position of the post-split vertex is equal to the weighted average of the vertices around it, a vertex with more edges attached to it will be pulled in more compared to a vertex with less edges attached to it.</p>
		<p>Splitting the edge before performing loop subdivision alleviates the affects because the direction of each edge that splits each face is not the same. Sometimes, it connects the top left corner and the bottom right corner, while other times, it connects the top right corner and the bottom left corner. After we perform the split, the edges on each face are the same across all faces, so the effects of loop subdivision are the same across all faces.</p>
